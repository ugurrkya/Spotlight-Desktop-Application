# Spotlight Desktop Application
a post sharing system that inspires each other and reveals talents
# Proposal
The project is about sharing posts related to people’s interests. The system is working this like; people in social media need to share their works of art, specific works, hobbies and other interests. There are many applications to execute this purpose on Internet with web-based applications and mobile devices such as Pinterest application, Instagram application, Deviantart.com website and Pixiv.net website. However, exactly, there is no application to execute the purpose in desktop application sense, just there are desktop versions of current mobile applications and web-based applications. People don’t need Internet connection only for sharing, they need mobile devices or some browsers in the same time. I thought that I can solve the problem and meet the deficit in desktop application sense. People can share their posts related to their interests and hobbies etc. In addition to this, they create an image about themselves in profile sense, and they can show themselves up in the platform. They may be famous person and steal the spotlight by using the platform, thus I gave the name to the application called “Spotlight”. There will be two entities in the system as users and an administrator. A user membership system will be used for the registration of users to system. Users can create a profile in the system by registration. They can share their posts on their own profile and they can see someone else’s posts by looking profiles. Some tags can be added to the posts. Thus, people can find posts that are related to topics, interests or hobbies. People can discover new interest areas and new people who have mutual interest area. They can show their experiences each other and develop talents with a new perspective in the platform. There will be real-time sharing posts in the app and these posts will be showed in the main page of the users. The system will be used on a desktop application. To create a desktop application, Java programming language with Swing will be used. NetBeans will be used as coding and developing area in Graphical User Interface sense. To execute database operations and connections, MySQL database system will be worked.
